# URL hooks

Usually when working with routing and URLs in React you use a library like [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)

But sometimes you just need to parse some params from URL path or search query and adding a fairly sizable library might feel like too much. 

`url-hooks` is a collection of simple React Hooks for dealing with URL params.
